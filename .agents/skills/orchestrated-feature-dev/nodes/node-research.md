# Node: Research

Focused context-gathering phase. Read the codebase to understand patterns, architecture, and affected areas.

## Input

Read the user's feature request from the conversation context.

## Execution

1. **Identify the feature area** — what part of the codebase is affected?

2. **Read broadly first:**
   - Entry points and main files for the affected area
   - Related tests to understand existing behavior
   - Types, interfaces, and data models
   - Configuration files if relevant

3. **Read deeply second:**
   - Implementation details in the core affected files
   - Patterns used in similar features (if any exist)
   - Utility functions and shared helpers that might be reused

4. **Research the standard approach:**
   - Use `@web-search` to find the standard/best/recommended way to implement this type of feature
   - Look for established patterns, common pitfalls, and industry best practices
   - Compare what you find externally with the patterns already in the codebase

5. When researching external libraries or APIs, use `@context7` for documentation queries and `@web-search` for broader research.

6. **Count what you read** — track the number of files examined.

## Output

Write findings to the `research-output.md` artifact in the brain directory:
