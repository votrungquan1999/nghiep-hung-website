# Meta Rules

These rules MUST always be followed unless explicitly overridden.  
For each task, Antigravity MUST double-check:

1. Which rules were applied.
2. Whether any relevant rules were missed.
3. If any rule conflicts exist, resolve them explicitly.

- ALWAYS check all applicable rules before making any changes.
- ALWAYS explain which rules were applied in the output.
- MUST keep files under **300 lines** for AI context management.
- NEVER require running/building the server to validate output.
- NEVER run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` after completing tasks, the user will handle this.
- ALWAYS use `npm install` to install packages. NEVER add packages directly to `package.json`.
- AI MAY replace entire components or structures if it improves clarity/compliance.
- For complex changes, AI MUST ask:
  - "Am I correct?"
  - "Which rules apply here?"
  - "Did I miss any relevant rules?"
- Apply the multi-shot method of prompt engineering: After editing around 5 files, should ask the user to review if the current direction is correct, then continue with the next 5 files. This iterative feedback approach helps ensure the AI stays aligned with user expectations and corrects course early if needed.

## Scope Management

- NEVER implement unused/future features not explicitly requested by the user.
- MUST ask 1-2 clarifying questions before implementing (or more if user explanation >100 characters).
- Focus on what exists in the system currently, not what could be extended unless explicitly requested by the user.
- When user provides long explanations (>100 characters), ask additional clarifying questions to verify scope and approach before proceeding.
- Only extract reusable components/functions when the same logic is repeated at least **3 times**. Two occurrences do not justify extraction — wait for the third to ensure a good abstraction emerges.

## Error Handling

- NEVER use try-catch blocks defensively around every operation.
- ONLY place try-catch blocks at intentional error boundaries where you want to catch all errors from lower-level code.

## Edit Verification and Retry Logic

- After EVERY file edit operation (using tools like `replace_file_content` or `multi_replace_file_content`), MUST verify that the edit was successful.
- If an edit fails:
  1. Read the file again using `view_file` to understand the current state.
  2. Retry the edit with corrected parameters based on the actual file content.
  3. Repeat the verification process after each retry.
  4. **If the edit fails twice consecutively**, split it into multiple smaller, independent edits targeting smaller sections of the file. Large edits are prone to timeouts — smaller, focused edits are more reliable.
  5. Continue this cycle until the edit succeeds or determine that manual intervention is required.
- NEVER assume an edit succeeded without checking the tool's response.
- If multiple consecutive retries fail (> 3 attempts), explain the issue to the user and request guidance.

## Test-First Enforcement

- When doing test-first: NEVER write implementation code before running the test.
- ONE test at a time. Run it. See the result. Then decide whether to implement.
- The test run is a GATE — skipping it is a rule violation.

## Planning Mode

- When in planning mode and a `.md` file has already been generated, ALWAYS create a new file for any plan changes requested by the user.
- NEVER modify the existing `.md` file when the user requests changes to the plan.
